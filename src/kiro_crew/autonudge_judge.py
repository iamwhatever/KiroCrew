"""Evidence for the ``nudge.wake`` judge, and the one call an auto-nudge tick makes.

The point module (``decisions.points.nudge_wake``) owns the questions, the bounded
state and the mapping. This module owns WHERE the evidence comes from: a watched
session's new transcript rows, a watched pull request's observation, and (later)
work-ledger events. It sits beside ``autonudge`` rather than under ``decisions``
because collecting is a gateway concern -- it reads live slot state -- while the
point stays a pure adapter that a test can drive with literals.

Why the reads arrive as CALLABLES
---------------------------------
``AutoNudgeService`` holds no ``DashboardState``: it is constructed with a data
directory and two callbacks, and the gateway injects closures that reach the rest
(``on_fire``, ``on_monitor_tick``, ``owner_session_id``). The session read is the
same shape, and it has to be, because authorizing it needs state the service
cannot see. So :func:`collect_evidence` takes readers and this module imports no
dashboard module at all -- which is also what lets every function here be tested
without a gateway.

Creator-only, enforced by reuse
-------------------------------
A ``session`` target is read through ``session_control.read_messages``, which
authorizes with ``authorize_target`` before returning a row: deny-by-default, and
SEL-audited on refusal. The judge therefore cannot read a session its owning loop
could not read by hand, and a target that refuses is DROPPED and counted rather
than fetched. Nothing here re-implements that check, because a second copy of an
authorization rule is a second place for it to be wrong.

Assistant rows only
-------------------
``decisions.points.HISTORY_ROLES`` excludes tool output from every other point on
the grounds that it is the largest and least selective text in a transcript and
routinely quotes files nobody mentioned. The same reasoning holds here, and the
evidence a watcher actually needs -- a worker's ``RULING:`` or ``BLOCKED:`` line,
a reviewer's verdict -- is an assistant row. Tool rows are skipped.
